# Multidisciplinary Precision Farming with IoT

## 🌱 Project Overview
**Team Name:** AgroBytes  
**Project Name:** Multidisciplinary Precision Farming with IoT  

Agriculture in Nepal faces significant challenges due to inefficient irrigation, unpredictable rainfall, and lack of real-time data for farmers. Our project leverages **IoT and AI** to provide a **smart, automated irrigation system** that optimizes water usage, improves crop yields, and enables data-driven decision-making for farmers.
